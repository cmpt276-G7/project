### Summary

Many thanks to [Michael Hartl's Rails Book](https://www.railstutorial.org/book/frontmatter)

Uses [Omniauth](https://github.com/intridea/omniauth) as the authentication system for Facebook and Twitter and [Boostrap](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap) for styling the website, among many other gems.

Currently, the app can only show a user's twitter feeds after authenticating due to permission limitations with Facebook and Instagram (ie. app was not approved to fetch user data from these platforms).
