# SFU CMPT276 Fall 2015 Group 7 Project

Group 7 Project. Will be documented... eventually.

Many thanks to [Michael Hartl's Rails Book](https://www.railstutorial.org/book/frontmatter)

Remarks (Nov 7):
-need to complete facebook implementation, but skeleton authentication is working
-create db columns to store fb authentication data
-[Koala](https://github.com/arsduo/koala) is actually very nicely documented, should use it for our API calls
