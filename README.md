Group 7 Project. Will be documented... eventually.

Many thanks to [Michael Hartl's Rails Book](https://www.railstutorial.org/book/frontmatter)

Nov.18
CSS Homepage:
- added padding to body top so when minimized, toolbar does not cover logo
- changed background color
- added carousel to homepage for sneak peak or ads, picture images possible
