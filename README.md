# SFU CMPT276 Fall 2015 Group 7 Project

Group 7 Project. Will be documented... eventually.

Many thanks to [Michael Hartl's Rails Book](https://www.railstutorial.org/book/frontmatter)


#### Some Notes (Jonathan):

##### Remarks (Nov 7):

~~need to complete facebook implementation, but skeleton authentication is working~~

~~create db columns to store fb authentication data~~

-[Koala](https://github.com/arsduo/koala) is actually very nicely documented, should use it for our API calls


##### Remarks (Nov 8):

-finished authentication with facebook, just need to clean up some code

-should work on interfacing, routes (users can't access other private stuff)

-need to familiarize more with Koala API specifically with facebook auth tokens

-start to do basic API calls on "news feed"
